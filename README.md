# Quantized Fine-Tuning of SLM for Specialized Agentic Tool-Calling

## 1.0 Introduction and Motivation

Agentic AI systems often require models to autonomously decide on the best action to fulfill a user's intent, a capability centered on tool calling. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable, they are often impractical for specialized, repetitive tasks due to high costs and latency. Small Language Models (SLMs) present a more efficient alternative.

This project demonstrates that an SLM can acquire complex tool-calling skills through targeted, memory-efficient fine-tuning. By specializing an SLM on a curated dataset, we create a powerful yet economical agent, validating the viability of this approach for real-world applications.

## 2.0 Research Question

**To what extent can LoRA fine-tuning enhance the tool-calling accuracy of a Small Language Model on specialized, unseen tasks compared to its base, zero-shot performance?**

## 3.0 Methodology

### 3.1 Phase 1: Model and Dataset Curation

- **Model Selection:** We selected `gemma-3-1b-it-4bit`, a 4-bit quantized Small Language Model optimized for consumer hardware (tested on 16GB MacBook Pro).
- **Dataset Curation:** We used the `Salesforce/xlam-function-calling-60k` dataset, a comprehensive function-calling dataset with high business relevance. We curated 1,000 examples to create a focused training environment.
- **Data Preparation:** The curated data was formatted into Gemma chat format with system prompts, user inputs, and structured function call outputs. The data was split into three distinct, non-overlapping sets:
    - **Training Set (80%):** 800 entries
    - **Validation Set (10%):** 100 entries  
    - **Test Set (10%):** 100 entries

### 3.2 Phase 2: Fine-Tuning

- **Technique**: We employed LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) with 4-bit quantization, a memory-efficient technique that makes fine-tuning large models on limited hardware feasible.
- **Implementation**: The process was implemented using MLX-LM, Apple's optimized machine learning framework for Apple Silicon.
- **Configuration**: 
    - Model: `mlx-community/gemma-3-1b-it-4bit`
    - Training iterations: 500
